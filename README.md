### Full Task description of project:

### Description:

--This project was a solo one. I tried to clone the page as much as i could.

--I've changed the header due to restriction; using pure html&css, so it has just position
 sticky to make its position fixed after scrolling down a little bit ^^

--I added 2 breakpoints for the page, one for 991px-1024px and other is for 768px-991px.
I've re-positioned and re-sized and re-styled elements depending on width of the 
window/page and i tried to make them seem as much as similar to original one. Also, 
min-width of the page is 500px and i've set everything for that value about their minimum 
sizes.
